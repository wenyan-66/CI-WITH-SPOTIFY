    steps:

    # This step copies your repository code to the runner
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4

    # This step sets up Python on the runner
    # TODO: Change the Python version to 3.12
     - name: Set up Python 3.12

    # The next steps use *run* to execute commands on the runner
    # This is just like typing commands in the Codespace terminal

    # This step installs dependencies
    # TODO: Replace the run block, using `uv` to sync the environment

    # This step runs unit tests with pytest
    # TODO: Update the run block. Use: uv run -m pytest
    # (we need -m so that our tests can find our notebook code)
    - name: Test with pytest
      run: |
        uv run -m pytest

    # This step runs the linter against the codebase
    # TODO: Replace the run block to use our preferred linter
    - name: Lint with ruff
      run: |
        uvx ruff check

    # TODO: Add steps to run formatting steps and type checking

    # Use uvx to run ruff format
