# This workflow will install Python dependencies, run tests and lint with a single version of Python

    steps:

    # This step copies your repository code to the runner
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4

    # This step sets up Python on the runner
    # TODO: Change the Python version to 3.12
    - name: Set up Python 3.12
      uses: actions/setup-python@v3
      with:
        python-version: "3.12"

    # The next steps use *run* to execute commands on the runner
    # This is just like typing commands in the Codespace terminal

    # This step installs dependencies, but we have an easier way
    # TODO: Replace the run block, using `uv` to sync the environment
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        uv sync

    # This step runs unit tests with pytest
    # TODO: Update the run block. Use: uv run -m pytest
    # (we need -m so that our tests can find our notebook code)
    - name: Test with pytest
      run: |
        uv run -m pytest

    # This step runs the linter against the codebase
    # TODO: Replace the run block to use our preferred linter
    - name: Lint with ruff
      run: |
        uvx ruff check

    # TODO: Add steps to run formatting steps and type checking

    - name: Format with ruff
      run: |
        uvx ruff format

    - name: Type check with ty
      run: |
        uvx ty check

    - name: Format imports with isort
      run: |
        uvx isort .
