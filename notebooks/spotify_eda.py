    # Reactive Plots

    _By [etrotta](https://github.com/etrotta)._

    This tutorial covers Data Visualisation basics using marimo, [polars](https://docs.pola.rs/) and [plotly](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/).
    It shows how to load data, explore and visualise it, then use User Interface elements (including the plots themselves) to filter and select data for more refined analysis.

    We will be using a [Spotify Tracks dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/maharshipandya/spotify-tracks-dataset). Before you write any code yourself, I recommend taking some time to understand the data you're working with, from which columns are available to what are their possible values, as well as more abstract details such as the scope, coverage and intended uses of the dataset.

    Note that this dataset does not contains data about ***all***  tracks, you can try using a larger dataset such as [bigdata-pw/Spotify](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigdata-pw/Spotify), but I'm sticking with the smaller one to keep the notebook size manageable for most users.

    You should always take a look at the data you are working on before actually doing any operations on it - for data coming from sources such as HuggingFace or Kaggle you can preview it via their websites, and optionally filter or do some transformations before downloading.

    The [Polars Lazy API](https://docs.pola.rs/user-guide/lazy/) allows for you define operations before loading the data, and polars will optimize the plan in order to avoid doing unnecessary operations or loading data we do not care about.

    Let's say that looking at the dataset's preview in the Data Viewer, we decided we do not want the Unnamed column (which appears to be the row index), nor do we care about the original ID, and we only want non-explicit tracks.
